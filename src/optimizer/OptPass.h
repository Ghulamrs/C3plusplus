// **The pass manager**, after GCC's: a pass has a name, a gate, an execute, the properties it requires,
// provides and destroys, and the work the manager does before it runs; a group is a pass with sub-passes, run
// while its gate holds and repeated by its policy; the pipeline is one declaration of the tree (OptPipeline.cpp), and a dump after any named pass shows the stream as that pass left it.
