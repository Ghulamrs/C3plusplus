// **What each level does, in one place.** -O1 is small code and -O2 is fast code, and both run the same pipeline: where a pass has two spellings of the same result, -O1 takes the smaller and -O2 the faster.
// That is how cl's /O1 and /O2 part (/Os against /Ot), and how GCC's -Os relates to -O2 (the same passes, size costs in place of speed costs); GCC's own -O1 is a subset of passes instead, which cxx1 does not follow.
// Every number a pass takes from the level is a question asked of a Costs, so a pass never tests the level itself. The two levels are the two classes below behind one interface: a pass that grows code (an inlined body, a cmov where a branch is shorter) is gated by what the costs answer, not switched off by level.
