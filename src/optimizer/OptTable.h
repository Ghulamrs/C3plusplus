// **One description of every x86 mnemonic the optimizer knows** - what GCC keeps in its machine description and cxx1 kept as a dozen lists spread over the passes.
// Each mnemonic has a kind, which says how `effectsOf` reads it, a set of flags the passes ask about, and the width its suffix names.
// The table records what the passes recognised before it existed, quirks included: `addq` names a width but is not arithmetic here, `sal` is a shift but not arithmetic, `testl` reads only through its operands but is not marked so. Each is a candidate for a later change; none is one now.
