# M6: tms6747 on the new middle end (ends exception 2)

Written 2026-11-13 by lane M6a (Opus 5.5) from `cd01e16b`. Design section 12's M6 row: *target 2 on the new middle
end, in steps each gated by sim6747 cycles*. The shape is `M5-PLAN.md`'s: what a step may change, how it is judged,
and "Where it stands" appended to as steps land.

## What exists at the start (measured, not assumed)

- **tms6747** is exception 2: `backend/Tms6747.cpp` (2,458 lines) over `backend/Walker.cpp` reads `Ast.h` - a serial
  stack machine over A4, NOPs in the delay slots - and its text goes through `optimizer/C6xSched.cpp` (2,297) and
  `optimizer/C6xPipe.cpp` (2,007) at -O1 and -O2. It was lowered to SSA only under `-dump=ssa`/`-check=ssa`.
- **x86's selection** (`backend/SsaSelect.cpp`) and arm64's (lane m5a, `backend/A64Select.cpp`) have the shape this
  follows: `Backend::setSsa` hands the module over, a function inside the subset is written from `ir::Function` into
  the walker's own stream, and the rest stay on the walker, one function at a time, each with its reason.

## Steps

| step | delivers | judged by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M6a | `backend/C6xSelect.cpp`: selection of `ir::Function` into the walker's text - 32-bit integers and pointers, arithmetic, compares, branches and block arguments, loads, stores, allocas, direct calls in registers, returns - the post-passes untouched; a per-function fallback named by reason (`CXX1_SSA_WHY`); `CXX1_C6X_WALKER` the walker all; a census row | tests/tms6747.sh and tests/asm6x.sh at -O0 and -O2 as before; sim6747 cycles of the selected cases against the walker's (equal or better, or named); `identical.sh ARCHS=tms6747` names each changed file |
| M6a.2 | the rest of the subset: 64-bit and floating values, class values and stack arguments, indirect and variadic calls, `-g`, then pads and the TI unwinder's tables from `ir::Function::landingPads`; census 0 walked | as M6a |
| M6b | selection emits MIR with schedule-aware allocation (values in registers, not words), still through the old post-passes | cycles equal or better case by case; tms6747.sh |
| M6c | the packetiser and pipeliner on MIR; `C6xSched`/`C6xPipe` text passes deleted once cycles are equal or better | the cycle table against M6a's; tms6747.sh, asm6x.sh |
| M6d | with no walker left on `Ast.h` (M5.3 and M6a.2), its nodes and the parser's building half deleted (design 12.2) | `tools/ast-residue` to 0; every suite |

**Lanes code, the coordinator gates** (`boxkit/brief-m3b5-par4.txt`). Every C6000 run is on the Linux box (TI's
tools in `~/ti6x`), never on the Mac.

## Where it stands

### M6a, round 1 (WIP), 2026-11-13, lane m6a

- **Landed (WIP):** `backend/C6xSelect.cpp` (new, ~330 lines); `Tms6747.{h,cpp}` +31; `Driver.cpp` 3 lines (tms6747 lowers
  and hands the module over, `CXX1_C6X_WALKER` the walker all, `level` passed to the lowering); `tools/ssa-census` 2 lines
  (the `-select: selected=` row); probe `tests/cases/c6x-select-scalars` (its .expected is the walker's and checked by
  hand - clang's from the Windows box is owed).
- **Subset:** words only (integers and pointers to 4 bytes), arithmetic, compares, branches, switch, block arguments
  through B16-B23, loads/stores (frame operands folded), allocas, direct calls of up to ten arguments in registers, returns.
  A function falls back to the walker with its reason under `CXX1_SSA_WHY` (`c6x-walker <sym>: <why>`).
- **Census** (tools/ssa-census -arch tms6747, before the last fix): 25,335 of 34,712 functions selected (73.0%); 12 other
  failures are the front end's target refusals (unistd.h, thread_local, realpath), not the selector's.
- **tests/tms6747.sh, vm6747 only (SIM=0), -O0:** walker 783 passed / 3 failed (the three noexcept cases, base); selector
  778 / 8 - five new wrong answers (namespace, namespace-relative-sibling, qualified-base-member-template,
  ssa-converted-arguments, using-declaration). The root found: a call passing a class of 8 bytes or less by value - TI
  passes it in registers, the IR a pointer to a copy; the refusal ("class argument", signature's class parameter) is
  written in the handover, not built. A function returning such a class was the first such fault, fixed and built.
- **Cycles:** worse, named - every value goes through its frame word (LDW + 4 NOPs), where the walker keeps A4: probe
  5,502 against 3,523 at -O0 and 1,760 against 746 at -O2; suite -O0 611.0 M against the walker's 447.7 M. Registers are
  M6b's; the cycle gate is not met by M6a round 1.
- **Gates:** cl /W4 /WX clean (Windows, before the last fix); exclusions 0 uncited 0 stale, comments 0 over, memory gate
  rc 0, ide/generate.py --check up to date. **Owed:** the class-argument refusal, then tms6747.sh with sim6747 at -O0/-O2
  (each run under 25 minutes: the SIM=1 leg reached the cap twice), asm6x.sh (C6XDIFF set in boxkit/m6a-gate.sh),
  identical.sh ARCHS=tms6747 by name (2,122 of 2,490 differed - every file with a selected function), -O2 cycles.
