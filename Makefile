# Built by g++ on the development box, and by clang++ on a Mac.
#
# Both work and both are checked: every translation unit compiles under
# -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic with Apple clang as well as with GNU g++, and
# the compiler that comes out is the same program. What differs is what you can
# then do with it - see "make help".
#
# Serial by design, and not merely as a preference. This box has 419 MiB of RAM
# and a class-heavy C++ translation unit was measured at 178-195 MB to compile;
# -j2 asks for twice that and meets the OOM killer. Use ./build rather than
# calling make directly - it puts the whole build inside a memory cgroup, so a
# runaway compile dies by itself instead of taking the machine down. That is
# not hypothetical: an unbounded `dnf` did exactly that on 12 August.
#
# Two different -j live in this repository and they are not related. This one is
# make's, building the compiler, and it stays at 1 because a C++ translation
# unit here costs 142 MB. cxx1's own -j compiles several files at once and is
# nothing like as hungry: a whole unit peaks at 4 MB.

# The host decides the compiler unless you say otherwise: "make CXX=g++-14" and
# "make CXX=clang++" both work anywhere either exists.
# origin, not ?=: make defines CXX itself, so ?= never fires. This overrides
# make's own default while still letting "make CXX=..." win.

# The headers cxx1 ships live in lib/, and are found by an absolute path baked in
# here because nothing installs this compiler - it runs from the tree it was

# somewhere else finds its own lib/ and not the one belonging to the tree this
# was written in.
#
# lib/ rather than include/, because none of what is in there is the language.
# The compiler is src/; the library it happens to ship is a separate thing that
# a program may ignore, replace with -I, or never reach for at all.

# std::string_view, for the borrowed text an operand carries; src/backend/
# Spelling.h has a small Str of its own in its place, and nothing else in src/
# reaches past C++14. Apple's libc++ hands you string_view in C++14 mode
# anyway, so a Mac build will not catch that kind of slip - g++ on the box
# will, which is the reason to build there before believing it.
