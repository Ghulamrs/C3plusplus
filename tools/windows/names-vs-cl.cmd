rem  Usage:  names-vs-cl.cmd <root>
rem  Writes  <root>\winnames\<case>.mine.txt  dumpbin /symbols on cxx1's object
rem          <root>\winnames\<case>.cl.txt    dumpbin /symbols on cl's object
rem          <root>\winnames\<case>.skip      when cl would not compile it

rem  **Why this exists when names.sh already checks the names.** That one asks
rem  clang with -target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc, which is a second
rem  implementation of the Microsoft ABI. This asks the ABI itself. CLAUDE.md
rem  says a Microsoft question goes to cl first and clang second, and until now
rem  every mangled name this compiler emits was checked only against the
rem  second - on a Mac, by a compiler that is not the one anybody links with.
rem  The two have already been seen to disagree: the secondary vtable and the
rem  biased `this` in thunk.cpp were settled by cl and not by clang.
rem
rem  **No comparison happens here**, for the reason run-cases.cmd gives about
rem  its own output: cmd is a poor place to cut up text and this box has no
rem  awk. The raw listings go back to the Mac and tools/verify-three does the
rem  reading, where one grep settles what a screenful of `for /f` would not.
rem
rem  /std:c++14 because cl has no C++11 mode - its floor is c++14 - so cl
rem  answers about the ABI and not about which language version a construct
rem  belongs to. /GR- and /EHsc- keep RTTI and exception tables out, the same
rem  flags measure.cmd uses and the same reason tools/mangled-names asks clang
rem  for -fno-rtti -fno-exceptions: this is a question about names.
