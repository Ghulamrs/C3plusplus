@echo off
rem  Build cxx1 with cl and put every case through it - the ones with recorded
rem  output and the ones that must be refused - in both x86_64-windows spellings.
rem
rem  Usage:  run-cases.cmd <root>
rem  Writes  <root>\winout\<case>.out for a case that runs and
rem          <root>\winout\<case>.err for one that must not compile, through
rem          the GNU spelling (assembled by clang), and the same names under
rem          <root>\winout\masm\ through -masm=masm, assembled by the project's
rem          own masm and linked by the project's own LINK - and nothing else.
rem  The comparison is deliberately NOT done here: a .expected
rem  file arrives with Unix line endings and a program's own output leaves
rem  through the CRT with Windows ones, so `fc` reports every case as
rem  different. tools/verify-three pulls these back and diffs them on the Mac,
rem  where one `tr -d` settles it.
rem
rem  **The refusals matter most on this target and were untested longest.**
rem  The parser is shared, so a diagnostic here usually repeats what the other
rem  two boxes proved - except where it does not: `throw`, `try` and a class
rem  with a destructor are refused *only* for x86_64-windows, and until this
rem  loop existed no box checked those at all.
rem
rem  **Both spellings, by default** (review D15, 2026-10-08): the MASM one had been
rem  run once by hand, and the project's masm refused 10 of 379 cases under a green
rem  suite. The project's tools are found, in this order:
rem    CXX1_MASM, CXX1_LINK      the two programs, named outright
rem    CXX1_MASM_SRC, CXX1_LINK_SRC   their trees, built here by cl into <root>\winout-tools
rem                              (default <root>\..\..\Windows\MASM and <root>\..\..\Windows\LINK)
rem  and where neither is found the MASM pass is not run, the reason is printed and
rem  the script exits 1 once the GNU pass is done. CXX1_CASES_SPELLINGS=gnu (or masm)
rem  runs one spelling alone.
rem
rem  CXX1_CASES_FLAGS, if set, goes on every compile of both passes - -O2, say.
