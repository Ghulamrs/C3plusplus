# Overload resolution, checked against clang rather than against a recorded
# answer.
#
# **Why this is a suite of its own and not more cases in tests/cases.** A case
# there carries a `.expected` file, which is a decision written down once - and
# for overload resolution the interesting question is not "what does this
# print" but "does cxx1 choose the function clang chooses". Those are the same
# question only while somebody keeps the recorded answer honest. Here the
# oracle is asked on every run, so the corpus cannot drift away from it.
#
# **It compares the verdict before it compares the output**, and that half is
# the one that catches real bugs. Overload resolution is as much about refusing
# an ambiguity as about picking a winner, and a harness that only diffs the
# output of programs that compiled would call "cxx1 accepted what clang calls
# ambiguous" a pass. Every file here is run both ways:
#
#   clang refuses  -> cxx1 must refuse
#   clang accepts  -> cxx1 must accept AND print the same thing
#
# Each program prints a number per call, and each overload returns a number of
# its own, so identical output means identical choices. `0 * argument` keeps
# the parameters used - so a warning about an unused one cannot hide a bug -
# without letting the value affect which number comes out.
#
# clang is needed, so this skips where there is none, exactly as names.sh does.
# The Linux box has no clang and reports the skip rather than a pass.
