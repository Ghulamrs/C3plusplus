# The tms6747 backend, run on the VM6747 emulator against the corpus's own
# expected output: every case in tests/cases that is meant to compile is
# compiled with cpp11 for the C6000, run on vm6747, and its stdout and stderr
# must match tests/cases/<case>.expected, as tests/run.sh requires of the
# host target. The cases that are meant to fail to compile (<case>.error)
# are the front end's and are not run here.
#
# Two lists of cases are skipped by name, each with its reason beside it:
# tests/tms6747-exceptions.txt, the cases that throw or need a landing pad,
# which this target does not unwind yet; and tests/tms6747-lp64.txt, the
# cases whose expected output was written by a 64-bit-long host. A case whose
# .notarget names tms6747 is skipped too, with its reason, as run.sh does for
# the host: it is a construct refused by name for this target.
#
# Each case runs twice: its assembly on vm6747, and as a TI program - asm6x, then lnk6x against
# TI's runtime - on sim6747, which runs the machine code. Both must match. The second leg is
# what sees an assembler's encoding and TI's own runtime (C1, C2, D2 hid from the emulator).
# SIM=0 leaves it out, said aloud; tests/tms6747-sim.txt names the cases it cannot run, why beside.
