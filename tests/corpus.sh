# The 424 C cases this compiler was forked with, run and counted.
#
#   tests/corpus.sh          run them all and print the split
#   tests/corpus.sh <name>   run one, and show what it said
#
# **This gates nothing and always exits 0.** The corpus came over from
# Compiler-C untriaged: it is C90, this is a C++11 compiler, and a case that
# stops compiling here may be a fault or may be C++ doing what C++ does - the
# string-literal rule alone accounts for a pile of them. A number from an
# untriaged corpus is not a pass rate and must not be quoted as one.
#
# What it is for is the *failing set*: tests/c-corpus/BASELINE records it (kind and name),
# and every run names each case that moved from it - still exiting 0. A case that moves between the two lists is the
# thing worth reading, and until this script existed nothing in the tree could
# say which cases those were - the number 379/424 was quoted eleven times in
# CLAUDE.md with no way left to reproduce it.
#
# Each case says what its program should exit with, in a `// expect: N` line.
#
# Each is compiled as a .cpp copy in $OUT: the driver turns a .c away by name
# (cxx1 compiles C++, not C), and what this corpus measures is C read as C++.
# Its headers are copied beside the cases, so #include "..." still finds them.
