# No assembler and no linker, so this runs on any machine cxx1 builds on -
# which is the point. A backend that cannot be run here can still be checked
# for having produced something rather than having fallen over.
#
# **The golden is what makes "this change emits the same code" a measurement.**
# Counting what compiled says nothing about what came out, so a refactor meant
# to change no behaviour had nothing here to prove it with. Record before it,
# run after it, and the answer is a number of files rather than a claim.
#
# It never fails the run. A changed file may be the whole point of the change,
# and a suite that refused one would be a suite people stopped recording.
